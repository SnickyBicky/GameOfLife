<br>The rules:
<br>1.Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
<br>2.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
<br>3.Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
<br>4.Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
